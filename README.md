# ncac

MUltlog code to go with the article "An Epimorphism between Fine and
Ferguson's Matrices for Angell's AC", forthcoming in [Logic and Logical
Philosophy](https://apcz.umk.pl/LLP/index).

To run this code, you need to install
[MUltlog](https://logic.at/multlog). (The version used to produce the
results in the paper is archived at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8475). Then:
```
# multlog
```
to start MUltlog in interactive mode. Load the supplementary code in
`ncac.pl`:
```
?- [ncac].
```
To run everything, say:
```
?- run.
```
